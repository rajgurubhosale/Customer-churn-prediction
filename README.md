# ðŸ“Š Telecom Customer Churn Prediction

### Buisness Problem:
Telecom comapnies suffers from the Voluntary churn,which occurs when customers leave the service provider
for a competitor. Telecom companies spend hundreds of dollars
to acquire a new customer and when that customer leaves, the company not only loses the future revenue
from that customer but also the resources spend to acquire that customer. Churn Reduces profitability.
Study shows that increasing retention rate by 5 % increase profits by 25% to 95%ðŸ˜².
To achieve this, itâ€™s crucial to identify the customers who are most likely to leave (churn),
so effective retention strategies can be implemented.

### ðŸŽ¯ Business Goal
* Develop a churn prediction model to flag customers most likely to churn.
* Perform EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) to identify key behavioral and service-related churn factors.
* Optimize retention spending by focusing only on high-risk customers.
